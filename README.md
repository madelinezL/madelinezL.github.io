Hi, I am Madeline Lin. Originally from Zhejiang, China, I went school in Austin, Texas and currently reside in New York. <br>\
Just as the figure of the book Madeline, I am cheerful, vigorous, love exploring the city and enjoy constantly learning new things. In my spare time, I lift weights, swim, study data science, visit cheese shops, binge on music and practice French.<br>\
I work for Deloitte as a transfer pricing consultant since June 2021. I engage in a spectrum of projects including global documentation, value chain alignment, audit defense, etc. to analyze and resolve international transfer pricing issues faced by multinational enterprises in a wide variety of industries.<br>\
