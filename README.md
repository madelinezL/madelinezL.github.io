Hi, I am Madeline Lin. Originally from Zhejiang, China, I went school in Austin, Texas and currently reside in New York. Just as the figure of the book *Madeline*, I am cheerful, vigorous, love exploring the city and enjoy constantly learning new things. In my spare time, I lift weights, swim, study data science, visit cheese shops, binge on music and practice French. <br>\
I work for Deloitte as a transfer pricing consultant since June 2021. I engage in a spectrum of projects including global documentation, value chain alignment, audit defense, etc. to analyze and resolve international transfer pricing issues faced by multinational enterprises in a wide variety of industries.<br>\
I studied accounting for my undergraduate degree, quantitative economics for my graduate degree, and recently finished a one-year data science certificate program. Starting from this April, I am also trying to learn more about finance field. Technology will shape what we learn and how we work. I hope to apply my analytical skills to the industries and transform my lives for the benefit of this society. I created this github to demonstrate the data projects, economic research that I've done, along with my study notes for data science and financial engineering.
